# pawarv-demo-01-start - Spring Boot Start

 Look at this after you have gone through `demo-02-simple-app` & `demo-03-web-app`.
   	
 1. This runs on port `8111`, so you can access it at http://localhost:8111
 2. The port is set here `resources/application.properties`
 3. The text `Hello World` is set here `resources/templates/index.html`
 4. Run this by `mvn spring-boot:run` from the root directory & the run option in your IDE.

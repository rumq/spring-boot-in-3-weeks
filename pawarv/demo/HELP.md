# Demo - First Spring Boot Application

 Look at this after you have gone through demo-02 & demo-03
   	
 1. This runs on port `8111`, so you can access it at http://localhost:8111
 2. The port is set here `pawarv/demo/src/main/resources/application.properties`
 3. The text `Hello World` is set here `pawarv/demo/src/main/resources/templates/index.html`
 4. Run this by `mvn spring-boot:run` from the root directory & the run option in your IDE.
